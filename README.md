# sqlSort - Sort arrays with sqlite!

## Here's how it works:
  * **1.** Array gets inserted into a database file, index by index.
  * **2.** Array gets selected from the database in ascending or descending order.
  * **3.** Array gets loaded from the database, index by index.
  * **4.** The array is now sorted!
